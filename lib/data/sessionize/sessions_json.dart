          "The finite state machine (FSM) is a 60-year-old Automata Theory concept that is widely used in electrical engineering, mathematics and… frontend development. Isn’t it surprising? When I attended Computer Science courses I thought I would never use such a concept as a web developer. Only a few years later, when I got a chance to work on a complex project with various user flows, I realized that using the FSM brings a big gain in building a predictable and scalable user interface.\r\n\r\nWhen preparing this talk I asked myself: \r\n- How might one benefit from implementing an FSM when building a user interface? \r\n- How to plan and implement an FSM?\r\n- How to test an FSM?\r\n\r\nIn short, this talk will walk you through all the important aspects of using an FSM in your frontend project.",

          "Dreaming of unloading Backend developers as much as possible, I decided to try to delegate the logic of grouping data in server requests to Frontend developers. GraphQL was chosen as the final solution. First, we made a couple of test projects on it and, after the checks, we started using GraphQL in customer projects. A lot of water under the bridge and knowledge about the features of the translation which could be shared has accumulated. In the process of transition, we encountered many features of this technology and the experience gained, at the moment, allows us to reveal the following points:\r\n\r\n* Pros and Cons of Switching to GraphQL\r\n* How to gradually switch to GraphQL\r\n* How to safely delegate data assembly logic to Frontend\r\n* How you can get the maximum effect from connecting GraphQL to a project with microservices\r\n* The disadvantages of technology that we realized only when we had faced with them\r\n* What you need to know in order not to shoot yourself in the foot while connecting GraphQL",

      "description":
          "Google Cloud provides a number of ways to deploy applications - Google Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run and Google Kubernetes Engine, amongst others. These differ vastly in the required setup and the methodology of resource management.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be an introduction (with a live demo) to deploying applications on the Google Cloud Platform. Be it a simple server, a script running a periodic job, or a complex distributed system, GCP offers myriad ways to handle these scenarios which we will explore in detail. I will demonstrate by deploying an application on various services, connecting it with data stores, etc. Hopefully this will serve as a broad scope introduction to Google Cloud Platform and enable listeners to choose the service for their project!",

      "title": "Training neural networks: A hacker's perspective",
      "description":
          "Despite the dauntless success of neural networks, the problem still remains - they can fail silently. This problem makes the job of debugging deep learning models very hard and being deep learning engineers/practitioners we often find ourselves in this situation. \r\n\r\nTo be able to approach the process of debugging deep learning models (and machine learning models as well) effectively, one needs a thorough understanding of the underlying principles that aid these models along with a set of practical guidelines. \r\n\r\nMy talk aims to shed light on two areas:\r\n- Training neural networks using a set of modern guidelines to adhere to the SoTA research practices\r\n- Debugging neural networks with an engineering and code-first mindset\r\n\r\nThroughout my talk, I will be sharing the tips and tricks I have accumulated from visionaries like Andrej Karpathy, Jeremy Howard along with my personal experiences. \r\n\r\nHere's a demo deck I had presented on this topic but I am also working on v2: http://bit.ly/2XwihXs\r\n\r\nI will be releasing a full-length article on this same topic as well. When it is out I will edit this proposal if needed :) The article is a part of a mini-series I am preparing with FloydHub. The series is based on structuring machine learning projects, aspects of handling, preparing data and deriving data-driven insights, debugging neural networks and much more. The first two articles in this series are published:\r\n- http://bit.ly/2XtMCeh\r\n- http://bit.ly/30N3bPA",

          "Join us for our Flutter Study Jam!\r\n\r\nFlutter is Google’s portable UI kit for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.\r\n\r\nTogether we'll work through Flutter codelabs prepared by Google instructors. You will be able to get hands-on experience with Flutter and build an app while learning the fundamentals.\r\n\r\nIf you develop and submit an application you will get a Certificate of Ending the Course\r\n\r\nThe Study Jams for Flutter is best suited for two audiences:\r\n\r\n1) Those with programming experience who have never used flutter and want to see what’s it all about.\r\n\r\n2) People who have some experience with Flutter and want to learn new ways to implement mobile/web apps in.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT INFO:\r\nBring a laptop! For the best experience, the laptop should have Flutter installed on it prior to starting the study jam to save time. Windows/Linux/Mac would all be fine.\r\n\r\nPlease check if after installing Flutter SDK your laptop can compile and run a basic empty app in Flutter.\r\n\r\nCheck out: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install\r\n\r\nPlease install Visual Studio Code if you don't have Android Studio already set up\r\nHow to install VsCode: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/vs-code\r\n\r\nWindows setup: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows\r\nMac setup: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos\r\nLinux setup: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux",
